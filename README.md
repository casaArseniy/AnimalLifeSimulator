# Animal Life Simulator

So far it simulates a number of herbivorous animals and some grass. Animals move randomly while trying to detect a nearby grass patch. Once detected, animal moves towards the grass patch to feed.

Grass patch is elimnated once fed upon. Grass gives animal energy to move.

If animal has no energy, it dies.

## To Do:
- Animal reproduction
- Animal evolution
- Grass reproduction
